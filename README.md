# Backbone Patch
Repository containing a Darwin Core Archive for small manual patches to the [GBIF backbone taxonomy](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c).
The dataset is registered in GBIF under https://www.gbif.org/dataset/daacce49-b206-469b-8dc2-2257719f3afa.


A checklist providing patches to the automatically assembled GBIF backbone taxonomy.
Names and their classification in this list will take precedence over other backbone sources, 
thus allowing small manual interventions in the backbone building process.
The list is hosted on github allowing for wider collaboration outside of the secretariat.


Names in this checklist should be removed once they appear in other trusted checklists. 
When adding new names into this list all entries should be assigned some remarks why this name exists and ideally a link to some other online resource via dc:references.
